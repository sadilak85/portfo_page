								<p>I prepared this portfolio page to present myself, focusing on my professional background. I hope that you will find more information about me here. </p> <p> So let's talk about what I'm doing so far. As a CAE Engineer, I do simulations stuff validating future electric vehicle platforms. More specifically, these validations are to ensure the car design to meet modern safety standards for an approval to be placed on a market, wherever the decision makers have chosen that market to be, of course. </p> <p> Yeah, well, maybe if you've asked me ten years ago, as I started my career in auto industry, I would probably say this sentence like this: "I do finite element simulations for static or dynamic analysis of mechanical components in complete vehicle". Hmm, it sounds probably boring compared to the previous one. </p>  <p> Did you also notice that I mentioned the word "electric vehicle" in this second sentence? Nope. Not that I am so bad at forecasting and predicting the future trends, but mainly the work I was doing for the industry was mainly for ICE cars at that time. Then suddenly I found myself doing simulation work for BMW i3, a very innovative electric car design, and then continued working for new challenge and trend.   </p>

								<p> What I am doing in detail? Now, technically speaking, as a skilled expert engineer in FEM analysis, I am simulating sophisticated
								technical problems, for example, static analysis of high stressed components, modal and frequency analysis of vibrating components, crash simulations, head impact simulations. I am implementing engineering solutions and adapting present knowledge
								to a new design concept. Past couple of years, I have been simulating crash scenarios, mostly for an early phase vehicle design. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="../static/assets/images/pic_02_01.jpg" alt="" /></span> <p> Currently, I work in an overseas office of a well reputed car company as an SUV maker in China, Great Wall Motors. In Munich office, I am the Crash and passive safety simulation expert who is responsible to deliver crash simulation results of an early-stage development phase for an electric vehicle platform among other experts in their fields. Together we deliver CAE validated designs, mainly conceptual chassis, BiW and assembly components.</p> <span class="image main"><img src="../static/assets/images/pic_02_02.jpg" alt="" /></span> <p> We have started a fully functioning office in Munich from zero with a team of experts in each field, setting up IT/network and hardware, negotiating for software licences, etc. Our simulation team defined post/pre-processing guidelines for each field, modelling standards to enable an efficient collaboration with the CAE teams inside the OEM. </p> <p>  Additionally, flat communication in a small team with experts in each field gave me various technical and non-technical experiences. These enabled me to see the car design process from above in such a multidisciplinary environment. My simulations and validations brought the early stage of the electric car platform design into further development </p> <span class="image main"><img src="../static/assets/images/pic_02_03.jpg" alt="" /></span> <p> Programming/Scripting for an efficient evaluation process was one of my crucial achievements in the absence of an automated CAE environment from the beginning. I increased my programming skills while inventing some evaluation tools (optionally) for the benefit of my company and as a free time activity (simulator program, mobile app etc). Why not to extend my computing and programming experience also in the future promising field "self-driving vehicle development" as well.  </p> <span class="image main"><img src="../static/assets/images/pic_02_04.jpg" alt="" /></span> <p> I have obtained new professional skills as a result of my personal responsibility through my commitment in a “start-up” atmosphere of this Munich overseas office. After many years of experience in automotive industry and car development processes, I see that I can widen my horizon and expand my knowledge whenever I have option to have a full engagement and responsibility on a process.</p> </p> You can have a look at my CV <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12zMAzGkbAnLDI_51QzkHqtZZgAoTyGV3/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> <p>

								<p> Everything is changing, modifying itself to a new world of technology. Engineers like any others need to update themselves. Let's take CAE for example, which is my expertise, FEM gained its popularity with computers emerging in the worldwide market. As new challenges appeared, new methodologies also appeared in this field. </p> <p> Iso-geometric analysis is a meshless method to provide directly mathematical formulations of models from their geometrical representation with NURBS, Splines. As computing technology evolved, even FEM mesh models with small element sizes continued to be used until today. Complexity of models is increasing to have accurate results, on the other hand, this is a challenge for FEM because more data, meaning more data storage and computer power, is required. </p> <p> CAE Future is in the hands of computers. Seriously, maybe you think "CAE means: computer aided engineering, so anything new?". But think about it, computers are there to help the expert doing pre and post processing. 100% computer decision is only taken in the "solution step", meaning "solvers". Therefore, still many decisions are taken by experts on the post processing for example. So a human is deciding on an evaluation process, which is somehow not sooo accurate, right? </p> <p> New considerations are taken now to overcome this challenge: more probable human made errors on much bigger data and more complex models. We will hear more in the future, also in CAE field, these words: "machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, neural networks". Experts and computers have been collaborating so far on evaluation process via scripting, toolboxes and mostly "session files". This very "expert dependent" task is vulnerable. However, computers need sufficient amount of data to decide like an "expert" for an evaluation. This data can be collected wisely, intentionally with the help of machine learning algorithms, to teach the computer to take a decision for a probable case even no simulation is done for that particular case yet! Sounds cool, and it is being a reality step by step.  </p> <p> After setting the background, I can now say that I did not sit and wait for a next task to have. But I started to learn more on those topics, developed my computer science knowledge. Programming ability is a "must-have" for CAE engineers, and also for any kind of engineers. </p> <p> Lets have a look at my recent certificates on my e-learning activities (partially selected ones): 
								<span class="image main"><img src="../static/assets/images/combined_certificates.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
								</p> <p> Learning is just a start and it is not completed until an action is taken. Action is "learning by doing" and practicing. For that reason, I started to do many other programming projects, as a daily routine, a hobby and an entertaining activity.</p> <p> I like playing chess, playing my musical instrument baglama, a turkish guitar:), reading books and learning new things. I added this new hobby to them and I even took advantage, automatizing my daily routines to have more time, etc. Believe it or not, if a new habit is not considered as a hobby, in other words, if it does not enjoy you, then it is not easy to develop skill for this habit. </p> <p> Last but not least, you can look at my GitHub profile on the "Contact" menu. You will have more idea on my other projects. Whenever a new idea appears in my mind, when this idea is validated and if it is also implemented in a real virtual environment, then you will be the one who will hear first. </p> <p> So feel free to contact me and connect to be the first one!  </p>
